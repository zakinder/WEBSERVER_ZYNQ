TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ */COUPLER_INST/FIFO_INST/FIFO_INST/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/*rstblk*/*PRE*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '30' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).
